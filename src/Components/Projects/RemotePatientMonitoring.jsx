      The Remote Patient Health Monitoring System using Arduino is an advanced healthcare solution designed to monitor a patient's vital signs in real time. It integrates an Arduino microcontroller with various medical sensors such as a heart rate sensor, temperature sensor, blood pressure sensor, and SpO2 sensor to continuously track health parameters. The collected data is processed by the Arduino and transmitted wirelessly using a Wi-Fi (ESP8266) or Bluetooth (HC-05) module to a cloud server, mobile application, or healthcare provider's system. This enables doctors and caregivers to remotely access the patient's health status from anywhere. In case of abnormal readings, an alert system using buzzers or notifications ensures immediate medical attention. The system is highly beneficial for hospitals, home healthcare, and telemedicine, allowing continuous monitoring of elderly, chronically ill, or post-surgery patients. By reducing hospital visits and providing early warnings for medical conditions, this technology enhances patient care, improves response times, and supports the growing need for remote healthcare solutions.
